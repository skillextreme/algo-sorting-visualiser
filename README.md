# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

## Introduction
The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This tool allows users to generate random arrays and observe how different algorithms sort these arrays in real time. The visualizer supports Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch how sorting algorithms organize disordered arrays into ordered sequences through captivating animations.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Explore the mechanics of different sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Customizable Array:** Generate random arrays of varying sizes to sort, allowing for a diverse range of visualization experiences.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the sorting animations to suit your pace of learning or demonstration needs.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices thanks to a responsive web design.

## How to Use
1. **Generate New Array:** Click on the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array of bars.
2. **Select Algorithm:** Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the buttons provided.
3. **Customize Array and Speed:** Adjust the number of elements in the array and the speed of the sorting animation using the sliders provided.
4. **Watch the Visualization:** Observe as the chosen algorithm sorts the array, visualizing the sorting process step by step.

## Setup
